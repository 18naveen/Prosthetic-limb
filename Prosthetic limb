Creating a complete library for IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), EMG (Electromyography) signals, and servo motor control involves multiple components and might be quite extensive. However, I can provide you with a simple example of how you can structure such a library using Python. Keep in mind that this is a basic demonstration, and you may need to adapt it to your specific requirements and hardware.

```python
# imu_emg_servo_control.py

class IMU:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize IMU parameters
        pass

    def get_imu_measurement(self):
        # Implement code to read IMU data
        pass


class EMG:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize EMG parameters
        pass

    def get_emg_signals(self):
        # Implement code to read EMG signals
        pass


class MotorController:
    def __init__(self, num_servos, num_stepper):
        # Initialize motor controller with the specified number of servos and stepper motors
        pass

    def control_servo(self, servo_id, angle):
        # Implement code to control a servo motor
        pass

    def control_stepper(self, steps):
        # Implement code to control a stepper motor
        pass


class RobotController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.imu = IMU()
        self.emg = EMG()
        self.motor_controller = MotorController(num_servos=10, num_stepper=1)

    def update(self):
        # Read sensor data
        imu_data = self.imu.get_imu_measurement()
        emg_signals = self.emg.get_emg_signals()

        # Process sensor data and control motors accordingly
        # Example: Control servo motors based on IMU data
        for servo_id, angle in enumerate(imu_data[:10]):
            self.motor_controller.control_servo(servo_id, angle)

        # Example: Control stepper motor based on EMG signals
        stepper_steps = sum(emg_signals)  # Adapt this based on your specific use case
        self.motor_controller.control_stepper(stepper_steps)


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    robot_controller = RobotController()

    while True:
        robot_controller.update()
```

This is a basic structure to get you started. Depending on your specific hardware and requirements, you may need to integrate specific libraries for IMU and EMG, as well as adjust the servo and stepper motor control logic.
